 * Transforms a file loader in order to add local files for development.
 * The way it works is that if a file isn't found in the local directory (specified by
 * local_dir_path) then it will fallback to the received loader. That way, local files overrides
 * remote files (from FPM, for example). This is basically useful on a development environment.
 * @param loader The base loader to fallback when there isn't a local file.
 * @param local_dir_path Where to look for local files.
 * @returns The transformed loader.
